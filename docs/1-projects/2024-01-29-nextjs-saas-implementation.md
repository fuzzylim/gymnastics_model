# Next.js Multi-tenant SaaS Implementation

**Status**: In Progress  
**Start Date**: 2024-01-29  
**Target Completion**: TBD  

## Project Overview

Building a modern Next.js application with passkeys authentication, multi-tenant architecture, and Vercel deployment.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Passkeys authentication working in production
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation implemented
- [ ] Deployed to Vercel with edge functions
- [ ] Performance metrics meet targets (<100ms auth checks)
- [ ] Security audit passed

## Current Tasks

See [todo list in main project](../../CLAUDE.md#implementation-progress)

## Implementation Log

### 2024-01-29: Project Initialisation
- Created project documentation structure
- Defined architecture approach
- Set up PARA filing system for docs
- Initialised Next.js 15 with TypeScript and App Router
- Configured Tailwind CSS and ESLint
- Set up project structure with multi-tenant considerations
- Implemented Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL schema
- Created multi-tenant database structure with proper relations
- Added authentication tables for passkeys support
- Built tenant utilities and context provider

### 2024-06-29: Database Infrastructure Updates
- Refactored from Docker to hosted Supabase for simpler development
- Implemented Row-Level Security (RLS) setup scripts
- Added tenant context provider for secure multi-tenant queries
- Created database testing infrastructure with Drizzle
- Enhanced auth utilities with proper tenant isolation
- Added comprehensive test suite for database operations

## Technical Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Passkeys via SimpleWebAuthn | Most mature WebAuthn library | 2024-01-29 |
| Row-level security for multi-tenancy | Simpler than separate databases | 2024-01-29 |
| Subdomain-based tenant resolution | Better for SEO and branding | 2024-01-29 |
| Next.js 15 App Router | Latest stable version with improved performance | 2024-01-29 |
| Australian English | Localisation for primary market | 2024-01-29 |
| Drizzle ORM | Type-safe SQL with excellent TypeScript support | 2024-01-29 |
| Shared database multi-tenancy | Simpler than separate databases, easier scaling | 2024-01-29 |
| Hosted Supabase over Docker | Simpler setup, better for rapid development | 2024-06-29 |
| Row-Level Security (RLS) | Database-level tenant isolation for security | 2024-06-29 |

## Blockers & Risks

- [x] Need PostgreSQL database for development (Supabase configured)
- [ ] Passkeys browser support varies
- [ ] Vercel Edge runtime limitations
